# Football Tracker

Track your favorite football matches and teams

## Environment Variables

This project requires an API key to access football data. Add your API key to a `.env.local` file in the root of the project:

```bash
VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key from `https://www.football-data.org/`.
